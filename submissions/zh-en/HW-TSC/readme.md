**Test Name:** A Multifaceted Challenge Set for Machine Translation
**Provider:** HW-TSC
**Language Pair:** zh2en & en2zh
**Size:** 2000/set
**Source of Data:** Wiki open-source corpus
**Reference:** Will be provided, translated by professional translators.
**Description:** As machine translation quality keeps enhancing, we are curious about whether normal test sets can still accurately measure model performance (you can’t use Grade 1 quiz to test a freshman’s ability). Should we increase the test set difficulty level? So we construct a challenge set of 2000 sentences, which contains four sub-categories: 

- word difficulty (low-frequency words in training data); 
- length difficulty (extreme long/short sentences); 
- grammar difficulty (measured by parse tree); 
- model learning difficulty (measured by word entropy).
